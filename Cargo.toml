# Cargo by default builds build (only) dependencies with opt-level of 0 even in the release profile.
# That makes sense, as such code is normally run only once. But `occt-sys` is special: it is a build
# dependency of `opencascade-sys`, but it compiles static libraries that do end up in the final
# binaries.
# So set the regular release opt-level. `cmake` crate then picks it up and passes to the C++ build.
